1. Documentation & Architecture
- Keep Docs Updated: Ensure Specification.md, README.md, and README-DEV.md are always up-to-date.
- Architecture Consistency: Any modification to the project's architecture must be reflected in Specification.md immediately.

2. Environment & Deployment
- Containerization: Use Docker to run the application in both development and production environments to ensure consistency.

3. User Interface (UI/UX)
- Visual Style: The application must feature a modern, polished, and aesthetically pleasing interface.
- Color Identity: Use #0866ff as the primary brand color throughout the application.
- Internationalization (i18n): The application must support multiple languages. Avoid hardcoding text strings; use localization keys instead to facilitate easy translation.
